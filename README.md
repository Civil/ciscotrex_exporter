# ciscotrex_exporter
Prometheus exporter for cisco trex traffic generator

external_libs and trex are from cisco trex v3.06

As trex's python client uses scapy and it is distributed under GPL, same applies for the current exporter

That is proof of conect prometheus exporter, that I tried to make a stand alone. It is not inteded to be used in production.

Code quality is also "PoC" level.
